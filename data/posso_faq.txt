How is Posso different from other preschools?
Posso differs from other preschools through its Multiple Intelligences inspired curriculum, bilingual learning environment, hands-on activities, and a primary school-style setup that helps children transition smoothly, all guided by experienced teachers focused on each child’s development.

What curriculum do you follow?
Our curriculum is inspired by the Multiple Intelligences approach and aligned with the Ministry of Education’s EYDF and NEL frameworks. It offers hands-on activities that support diverse learning styles, problem-solving, and self-expression across various areas of intelligence.

Is this a bilingual programme?
Most subjects, such as Music & Movement, Art, Cookery, and Science, are taught in both English and Mandarin. This bilingual approach allows children to use and express their learning in both languages throughout the day.

Do you prepare children for Primary 1?
We support a smooth transition to primary school by introducing activities that build confidence and readiness. With classroom rotations and multiple subject teachers, children adapt to different environments and teaching styles. They experience primary school elements like ting xie, spelling, and Show and Tell to develop academic skills and confidence.

What kind of enrichment do you offer?
Our programme includes Cookery, Art, Science, and Music & Movement, and is integrated into the children’s daily schedule, with lessons taught by our teachers and guided by clear learning outcomes.

How is your daily routine structured?
Our daily routine balances learning, rest, and play, with lessons from subject specialists and regular returns to the form classroom for meals and nap time, supporting a consistent and engaging learning experience.

What does my child learn at each level?
Each level builds progressively, starting with routines, communication, and motor skills in PG–N1, leading to writing, problem-solving, and group projects by K2 to prepare for Primary 1.

Do children nap?
Yes, children from all levels are encouraged to nap during the day, with quiet rest offered for those who do not sleep.

What if my child is not toilet trained?
If your child isn’t toilet trained before starting school, don’t worry. Our experienced staff support toilet training and encourage independence at each child’s pace, working closely with you for consistency between home and school.

Do you have subject-specialist teachers?
Yes, at Posso, children attend lessons taught by subject-specialist teachers across various subjects, ensuring expert guidance and a rich learning experience.

What’s your approach to settling in new children?
We use a gradual approach to help children settle in, starting with half days and allowing parents to accompany them if needed. Teachers collaborate with families and support comfort items, gradually helping children adjust at their own pace.

Are your teachers trained and qualified?
Yes, all subject specialists are ECDA-certified, or undergoing certification, and we conduct regular in-house training to maintain high teaching standards across all locations.

How do you support different learning styles or needs?
Our Multiple Intelligences approach recognises that children learn differently, through movement, music, visuals, and more, and our rotating classroom model supports this flexible learning style.

How do you keep parents informed?
We keep parents informed with updates like messages, progress reports, parent-teacher meetings. We also share regular photo updates to help you stay connected with your child’s learning and development.

Can I visit the school before deciding?
Yes, you’re welcome to visit the school before making a decision. We encourage visits so you can see our environment and learn more about our programme firsthand.

Do you offer progress updates?

Are field trips and enrichment classes included in the fees?

Do you offer subsidies?

Are there any extra costs for books or field trips?
Learning materials and outings are included in the programme fee. Optional reader programme books are chargeable. We’ll provide all the details upfront so you can plan accordingly.

Do you provide meals? Are they healthy?
