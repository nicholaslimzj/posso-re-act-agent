What sets Posso apart from other preschools? 
We focus on confident, capable learners through structured rotation classrooms, full bilingual immersion, small class sizes, and integrated enrichment at no extra cost. Our teachers are warm, well-trained, and supported — and many have been with us for years. Parents love the calm, nurturing vibe and the clear routines that help children thrive.

How is Posso diff erent from other preschools? 
We design each part of your child’s day with intention. From the subjects we teach to how children move between classrooms, every detail supports learning and confidence. Unlike many schools, enrichment is not just an add-on — it’s part of the day.

What curriculum do you follow? 
We follow the Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) framework by ECDA and incorporate the Multiple Intelligences approach in our teaching. This means your child engages in a variety of hands-on activities that support diff erent ways of learning, problem-solving, and self-expression across multiple areas of intelligence. We follow the NEL (Nurturing Early Learners) framework by ECDA and apply the Multiple Intelligences approach. This means your child learns through a variety of hands-on activities, rotating between diff erent classrooms for subjects like Math, Cookery, Chinese, and Music and Movement.

Is this a bilingual programme? 
The majority of our subjects, including Music & Movement, Art, Cookery, and Science, are conducted in both English and Mandarin. This bilingual approach enables children to apply and express their learning in both languages across various subjects. As Mandarin is not limited to Chinese lessons alone, children are immersed in both languages throughout the day. Yes. Every class has an English teacher and a Chinese teacher. Children use both languages naturally across the day, so they’re not learning Mandarin just in a single slot, but hearing and speaking it across music, movement, storytelling, and play. Yes, we do have subjects taught in English and Chinese. Not necessarily 1 English and 1 Chinese teacher in a class. Depends on the assistant teacher. We do not just have a chinese lesson but we have lessons such as music and movement, cookery, little explorers/science, art taught in chinese as well.

Do you prepare children for Primary 1? 
We aim to bridge the gap between preschool and primary school by introducing activities that help children transition with confidence. Apart from being academically ready, our classroom rotation and having multiple subject teachers is a setup similar to that in primary schools. Children adapt to diff erent classroom environments and teaching styles, preparing them for what lies ahead. From K1, we also introduce primary school experiences such as ting xie and spelling, while building their confidence and public speaking skills through activities like Show and Tell. Yes, especially in K1 and K2. Children learn reading, writing, Math, and practical life skills. But we also focus on independence, social skills, and confidence — so they’re not just academically ready, but emotionally prepared for Primary 1. Our K2 also starts to learn Han Yu Pin Yin. In K1/K2 they have spelling and tingxie which teachers will also revise with them in school. Parents are strongly encouraged to reinforce it at home. Our termly show and tell session in both english and chinese which starts in N2 also gives them the opportunity to build on their public speaking skills.

What kind of enrichment do you off er? 
Our programme includes cookery, art, science, drama, movement, and music. These are not extras — they are included in the daily schedule, taught by our own teachers, and planned with learning outcomes in mind.

How is your daily routine structured? 
Throughout the day, children attend five diff erent lessons, each taught by a subject specialist. Despite moving between classes, they return to their form classroom at designated times, such as lunch, nap, and tea breaks, to meet with their form teacher and maintain a consistent routine. Children follow a predictable but engaging rhythm. They move between classrooms based on subject, enjoy snack and outdoor time, and have enrichment in between. Younger children have nap time in the afternoon, while older ones have quiet time or project-based learning. All the children are strongly encouraged to have their naptime as we want them to have sufficient rest before their afternoon lessons. For children who are unable to sleep, they are encouraged to rest on the cot.

What does my child learn at each level? 
Each level builds on the last. Younger ones (PG–N1) focus on routines, communication, and motor skills. By K2, children are writing short stories, solving word problems, and working on group science projects — all in preparation for Primary 1.

Do children nap? 
All children from PG to K2 are given time to nap or rest after lunch as part of their daily routine. Yes. Children in PG to N2 take naps after lunch. K1 and K2 children no longer nap, but they get quiet rest time.

What if my child is not toilet trained?
If your child is not yet toilet trained before starting school, please don’t worry. This is something we’re very familiar with and we encourage independence at each child’s own pace. Our staff are experienced in supporting children through toilet training and will work closely with you to maintain consistency between home and school. That’s okay. Our teachers support toilet training gently and consistently, working closely with each family’s routine. You don’t need to have this sorted before school starts.

What is the teacher-to-child ratio at Posso? 
● PG: 1 teacher to 8 children 1:6 
● N1: 1 to 12 1:8 
● N2: 1 to 15 1:10 
● K1/K2: 1 to 20 K1 1:12, K2: 1:15
Assistant teachers support classes, especially at younger levels.

How big are the classes? 
On average: 
● PG: around 8 up to 12 
● N1: 10–12 can take up to 16
● N2: 12–15
● K1/K2: 18–20
We keep groups small enough to allow for individual attention.

Do you have subject-specialist teachers? 
Yes. Children learn from diff erent teachers across the day — English, Chinese, cookery, movement, art, etc. This means each subject is taught with deeper knowledge and energy. It also helps children build confidence in interacting with diff erent adults, not just one.

What’s your approach to settling in new children? 
We go slowly. Younger children may be accompanied by a parent at first, then gradually transition to full days. Teachers keep close communication with families and adapt to the child’s needs. Parents are allowed to accompany the child for the first half day in school until 12pm. For the first 3 days, the teachers will send a short write-up on how the child is doing in school followed with photo updates. Subsequently, every Friday, the teachers will upload at least 3-5 photos of the child engaged in classroom activity. We also have our communication book where the teachers will send a daily routine update for children from PG to N2 which includes information like menu, portion, bowel movement, nap timing etc. We believe these are essential information for parents to find out how their child is doing in school during routine. If they need a comfort toy/blanket, parents may provide it for the children and we will work together to slowly wean it off .

Are your teachers trained and qualified? 
Yes. All lead teachers are ECDA-certified or in the process. We also run regular in-house training and planning sessions to ensure high teaching standards across all locations.

How do you support diff erent learning styles or needs? 
Our Multiple Intelligences approach means we don’t expect every child to learn the same way. Some may learn better through movement, others through music or visuals — and our rotating classroom model allows for this flexibility.

How do you keep parents informed? 
We use a secure communication app to update you daily — meals, naps, activities, and photos. Teachers also send regular term summaries, and we check in if anything needs your attention.

Can I visit the school before deciding? 
Yes. We highly encourage tours. It’s the best way to get a feel for the environment and ask any questions.

Do you offer progress updates? 
Yes. Teachers share regular progress summaries, and we have parent-teacher check-ins to discuss your child’s development and school readiness. Twice a year Parent Teacher Conference.

Are field trips and enrichment classes included in the fees? 
Yes. Everything is included — you won’t get surprise bills for activities or parties. External enrichment classes like Robotics not included, additional charges to it. Will be conducted after curriculum hours.

Do you offer subsidies? 
Yes. We accept ECDA subsidies and can help guide you through the process. The amount depends on household income and working status.

Are there any extra costs for books or field trips? 
No. All learning materials and outings are covered in the programme fee. Reader programme books from N2 onwards are chargeable

Do you provide meals? Are they healthy? 
Yes. We serve breakfast, lunch, and snacks. All meals are part of the Healthy Meals in Pre-schools
Programme (HMPP) and follow HPB guidelines. Meals are balanced and prepared fresh. Our lunch is catered from Gourmetz.

Are your centres SPARK certified? 
Yes. Our centres meet ECDA’s quality assurance standards. We’ve also been awarded the Healthy Preschool Platinum Tier for our approach to nutrition and well-being.

How do you handle allergies? 
We take allergies seriously. Let us know your child’s dietary needs during enrolment, and we’ll work with you to ensure safe alternatives.
